ServiceUNO Project (Concept)
ServiceUNO will be an application with a web interface, it will eventually be integrated by using hardware such as the raspberry pi. ServiceUNO will collect key data that will be quantified based on key services provided by the server and bartender. This information will also be valuable to businesses, the business will benefit from the data to evaluate customer service experience and improve their services by customer feedback. ServiceUNO will rate the server and feature their great customer service skills in order to maximize their gaining potential (TIPS).
